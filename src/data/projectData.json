Rate limiting is handled via Upstash Redis using custom-built distributed token bucket algorithms, ensuring scalability under load. Shared TypeScript types are managed across backend and frontend via a monorepo with custom shared packages to maintain type safety throughout the application.\n\nThe frontend is built with React and Mantine UI, providing a highly responsive, clean user experience while allowing users to quickly generate, browse, and preview multiple AI-generated magic items simultaneously. Project designed for eventual extensibility into full character, monster, encounter, and location generation.\n\nKey technologies: Typescript, React, Mantine UI, Node.js, Express, Firebase Functions, Cloudflare Workers, Upstash Redis, OpenAI API, Zod, RESTful API Design, SaaS-style architecture."
